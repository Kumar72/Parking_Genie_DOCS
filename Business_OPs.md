#1 Time Frame to reserve a Parking Genie spot
The user can reserve a Parking Genie spot in these different time frames:
30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, and 24 hours. 

#2 Alerts
Parking Genie app will send an alert/notification reminding the user how much time he has left until the reservation ends and needs to leave the parking spot. This alert/notification can vary from 15, 10 or 5 minutes prior the time is up and will ask the user to renew the time reserved or confirm time schedule to leave. 
The app will notify the user 15, 10 or 5 minutes before that their trip is about to begin.
If the user hasn’t started the trip on time scheduled it will also notify 10 and 5 minutes after user was supposed to leave, and to re-confirm the reservation. 
If user hasn’t confirmed any notification past 5 minutes after last notification sent, the reservation will be automatically cancelled and the spot will become available immediately.
