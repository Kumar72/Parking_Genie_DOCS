  <b>What is Parking Genie ?</b>
</p>

  Parking Genie is our attempt to take the _pain away from parking_. In many large or medium cities parking is a major problem. Number of cars keep on growing but parking spaces have stayed limited. There have been documented cases of people getting into parking lot rages. A lot of precious time is wasted when searching for a prime parking spot next to your favorite restaurant, near the entrance of your local mall, or to save you time before a job interview.  What if you could reserve a parking space? Luckily, there’s an app for that! In it, you can log in and pick that prime spot next to your destination, wherever that is. Plan and control your valuable time, from source till destination, without a charge.
Be Smart, Park Smart. _<b>Parking Genie.</b>_
  	#### How it works?
### How can I identify my Parking Genie Spot?
All parking spots inside the Parking Genie Community are conveniently marked by the logo of Parking Genie in them. Also, you can find your specific spot by an ID/serial number found at each parking spot. So, there’s no mistakes, no lagging, no time lost.

### Is this just a Parking App?
NO. This is a multi-task App specially designed to help you:  <b>S A F E + T I M E</b>
<b>S A F E</b>: It helps you travel safely. We’ll help you to improve your driving (speed limits, crowded areas, law enforcement controlled) by our signature database and shared feed of people just like you. You’ll arrive to your prime spot reserved by us to your desired destination adding safety to your arrival, or to know if its safe to arrive at all. 

<b>T I M E</b>:  To arrive, first you need to know where you’re going; and this is exactly what Parking Genie helps you with. You will never have to circle the block again or the five-story parking building on search for a spot. Don’t risk a ticket or worst, a towing. You can also monitor your way there, in case of any delays or ways to improve your driving and road ahead.
