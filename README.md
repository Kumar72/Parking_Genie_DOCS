  <b>What is Parking Genie ?</b>
</p>

  Parking Genie is our attempt to take the _pain away from parking_. In many large or medium size cities parking is a major problem. Number of cars 
  keep on growing but parking spaces have stayed limited. There have been documented cases of people getting into parking lot rages. A lot of precious
  time is wasted by people trying to find a prime parking spot next to that special store. What if a user could reserve a parking space ? There
  could be an app that they could log into and they could pick that prime spot next to their favorite store and reserve it. They could pay a minimal 
  amount for the privilege of having that spot reserved for them and available to them when they wanted. The store would get a confirmed customer and 
  maybe for that benefit could pass on some extra discount to this loyal customer.  
  
  #### Use Case 1 (Mall Case)
  
  An Indiviual reserves a spot for an hour. They can do this using an app on their phone or from "Parking Genie" website. Spot is sponsored by e.g. Pottery Barn. If the user shops at the store they get an added discount, if they do not shop at the store they pay a minimal fee for the privilege of having a reserved parking spot.  
  
  #### Use Case 2 (Company Case)  
  
  An individual parks in a sponsored parking spot. The spot is sponsored by a restaurant. Individual may be visiting the company for an interview. They enter the start time of parking and end time of parking when leaving. Based on the time spent in the parking spot they could be emailed a tiered discount to the restuarant. If they visit the restaurant within a certain time limit they can avail the discount, otherwise it expires
  
  #### Use Case 3 (Metropolitan downtown)
  
  An individual reserves a parking spot in downtown LA. The spot is sponsored by a local business. They visit the business and they make a purchase. They get a discount for the purchase. They have the option to not purchase and get a ticket for a discount to use in the finite future time or they can payment of minimal amount for the privilege of using the spot.
